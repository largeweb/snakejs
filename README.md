# snakejs

Pretty basic Snake game, built in a nice all-in-one-codebase HTML file. Me and two of my close friends worked on this together one night, using lots of boilerplate from an online tutorial, and adding our own features and hosting it online to play. Right now there are a few bugs with enemy spawning.
